RateMyself is a rating review website where users can review people and provide a rating from one to five. The web application will have the following key features, user registration, user authentication, user having the ability to post a review, user viewing the reviews, user disputing an review, and blog posts by admins. It can be thought of as having similar user functionality as ‘ratemyprofessor’. The inspiration behind this application is that we wanted a way for people to be able to get constructive feedback from others to become a better version of themselves. 

The application can be found here:
